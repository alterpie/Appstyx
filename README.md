# Overview
Welcome ðŸ‘‹!
We at [Appstyx](https://appstyx.com) are looking forward to hire new Android developers.

If you came across this page randomly we'd like to inform you that this repository contains an exercise that is meant to evaluate your skills: if you are interested in joining our team please have a look at our [job offer](https://androidjobs.io/jobs/android-developer-b6282a3a52) and drop us an email at `info AT appstyx DOT com` first.

Please complete the following tasks to help us better address your Android experience, we can't wait to have you onboard! We'd love to see the kinds of decisions you make given the existing code, nature of the app and time constraints (please don't spend more than 4 hours on it, time is precious).

## General instructions
- fork this repository, or clone it and push it to a private repository of yours, and start from the `develop` branch to apply your changes;
- complete as many tasks as you'd like but follow the requested order;
- use all the third-party dependencies you may need but elaborate on your choices;
- share the link to the forked repository, if public, or invite `@matteinn`, if private.

## Tasks
1. Add a new dropdown field below "Last Name" to let users pick their gender. The list of genders has to be fetched from the API.
2. Add validation on the signup screen: when clicking on the "Signup" button and any of the fields is empty please show an inline error like [this](docs/validation.jpg).
3. Perform the signup API call when clicking on the "Signup" button with all fields correctly set: in case of errors please show them inline, in case of success move to the Home screen and store the token for subsequent authenticated API calls.
4. Change the routing logic to redirect already authenticated users to Home, while unauthenticated ones should land on the Signup screen.
5. On the Home screen perform the API call to fetch user data and load that info on screen (avatar, first name, last name) like [this](docs/user.jpg).
6. Implement the "Logout" logic on the home page, redirecting the user to the signup screen afterwards and clearing the auth credentials.

## Notes
- all details about the APIs can be found [here](docs/API.md)

## Your thoughts
_Please add here any comments about decisions you made while implementing the requested changes, reasoning about any dependencies you may have added to the project, any issues you may have faced, problematic code you would like to change..._

Task 1: this task took most time as I needed to setup all infrastructure(Repository, API, DI etc) and introduce some common classes to reduce boilerplate. I haven't implemented any error handling for genders loading as I assumed it is out of context of the task.

Task 2: validation is done inside ViewModel for the screen. As we have just 1 screen that requires some validation it is convenient to have it there. But in case of larger app most probably several screens will require similar validation so it this case more convenient way yo implement it would be to create a Validator interface that provide methods for validation of specific input(like validateEmail, validatePassword methods).

Task 5: error handling not implemented as was assumed that it is out of the context of the task

One of the decisions was to remove Event class in favor of using SharedFlow. Event class is a bit hacky and is limited by possibilities of LivaData whereas using SharedFlow you have all possibilities that Flow API provides and also you have consistent data flow that is using only coroutines and Flow API without intermediate transformations to other types.

Also I simplified a boilerplate related to handling ViewBinding for Fragments: now you don't have to nullify instance of ViewBinding because it is created and more important USED in the body of just one method using LifecycleCallback mechanism from Jetpack. So when callback is removed automatically ViewBinding instance will be garbage collected.

I'd love to discuss any other decisions and libraries you'll find interesting to talk about. Hope to hear from you soon!
